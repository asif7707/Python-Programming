Don't invest yourself in the wrong people.
Because when you invest yourself in the wrong people.
They break you in to pieces.They torn you apart.
In such a way
That it takes years and years to get back together.
While you are busy 
Making amazing plans in your life.
My dear prepare yourself for worse.
Because life is so unpredictable.
Just be prepared.
